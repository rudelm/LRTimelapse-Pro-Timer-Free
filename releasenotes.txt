- Added Left click Single Exposure screen. From the main (interval) screen press left, to reach the Single Exposure screen. Here you can either briefly trigger a single shot from the camera (press left) or you can use the up/down keys to set a bulb time.
Thanks to user Colin that brought up the idea in his fork on https://github.com/ColMol/LRTimelapse-Pro-Timer-Free/tree/master/LRTimelapse_Pro_Timer_Free)

- Added Shooting-Mode menu, M vs. Bulb
- New Bulb timelapse shooting mode for astro-photographers that would like to define the exposure time via the timer: in M-Mode, the trigger time by the timer will be the shortest possible for regular timelapse shooting, exposure will be set in the camera. In Bulb-Mode the exposure will be controlled and can be defined in the timer. The maximum possible exposure will be Interval - 0.5 secs dark time. This dark-time is defined as constant in the source code and can be changed, if necessary.
- Improved key responsiveness
